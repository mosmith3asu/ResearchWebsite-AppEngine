                <h2>Advancing AI through interactive experiments</h2>
                <p>Welcome! This website is intended to allow you to easily participate in experiments supporting research into cognition-aware AI partners.
                    Our goal of enabling "cognition-aware" AI simple means providing robots or AI partners with a deeper understanding about how humans
                    evaluate, reason, and make decisions when interacting with artificial agents. This is done by programming the artificial agent to
                    consider well studied principles from the fields of cognitive psychology, economics, and neuroscience.
                </p>
                <p>However, we need your help  to validate and test these new models we are studying! If you are interested in contributing to
                    research on cognitive-aware robotics, then please click the button below to join one of our short, interactive experiments.</p>
